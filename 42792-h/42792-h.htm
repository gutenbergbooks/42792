<h3>INEDITED LETTERS OF GENERAL GREEN AND OF WASHINGTON.</h3>

  <p>The letters of great men are always interesting, more particularly
  when they are connected with important historical facts. I presume,
  therefore, that those I subjoin from General Washington and General Green
  will not be unwelcome to your readers. They were among the papers of an
  officer, long deceased, who at the time was aide-de-camp to Sir Guy
  Carlton, the commander-in-chief of our army in America; and were, I
  presume, intercepted before they reached their respective
  destinations.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="ac">"<i>General Green to General Washington.</i></p>

  <p class="author">"Head Quarters on Ashley River,<br/>May 31st, 1782.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sir,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"I had the honor of informing your Excellency, in a letter of the 19th
  instant, that a dangerous spirit of discontent had been discovered in the
  army, and of the measures I took to suppress it. I am happy to inform you
  that this spirit seems entirely to have subsided, as the persons who
  fomented it are removed at a distance from the troops: and, as we have
  now a prospect of some cloathing, and more comfortable supplies, I hope
  it will no more appear.</p>

  <p>"Your Excellency has been informed of the late important and
  interesting changes in the face of affairs.&mdash;The arrival of Sir Guy
  Carlton, and the change of ministers and measures, will open a new field
  of hopes for this country. How far we may be benefited by it, a little
  time will determine; but it will inevitably be attended with one bad
  consequence, as it will relax our preparation for a continuance of the
  war, which, to me, appears extremely probable. General Leslie has made
  overtures, and a proposition for a suspension of hostilities; I do myself
  the honor to inclose you copies of his letter, and my answer on the
  subject, from which you will see the ground on which it stands. I wait
  most anxiously for advices from Congress or your Excellency, by which my
  conduct in the business must be ultimately directed. I suppose this
  measure has been adopted <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page278"></a>{278}</span>by Sir Guy Carlton, and proposed to your
  Excellency; but, as I am entirely at a loss to know on what conditions,
  and what purposes it has to answer, I can form no conclusive opinion on
  its propriety.</p>

  <p>"I am sanguine that the operations against Jamaica will go on,
  notwithstanding the late misfortune, which seems to be rather a splendid
  than useful victory to the enemy. And as Count de Guichen, who has
  arrived with a considerable squadron, and taken the command of the
  combined fleets in the West Indies, is still much superior to the
  British, we have good reason to hope the enterprise may succeed.</p>

  <p>"Inclosed, I transmit your Excellency the Report of Brigadier-General
  Wayne of a considerable skirmish in Georgia, wherein Lieut.-Col. Brown,
  with four or five hundred men, were defeated. The plan was judicious, and
  executed in a manner that does great honor both to the general and the
  troops. It will have very happy consequences in impressing the Indians
  with an idea of our superior power, and in the destruction of their
  cavalry.</p>

  <p>"The enemy continue their camp, entrenched at the Quarter House, in a
  strong position. Their patroles of horse, and ours, frequently go over
  the same ground. Captain Armstrong of the Legion, and Captain Gill of the
  fourth regiment, with about forty dragoons of Lieut.-Colonel Laurens's
  command, fell in with a troop of their horse two days ago, and took an
  officer, eight men, and ten horses, without suffering any other in injury
  than two men wounded.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"From the inclosed information of Captain Stevens, there is reason to
  apprehend the business of driving cattle to the enemy is carrying on with
  great art and assiduity; it would be a happy circumstance if the villains
  concerned in it could be detected. I have therefore to propose to your
  Excellency, that you will be pleased to take such precautions as you
  shall judge best calculated to learn whether any such cattle are passing
  in droves, or smaller parcels (for they may be divided on the road), to
  the enemy.</p>

  <p>"If your Excellency should hear of them before they turn off towards
  New York, I think it would be advisable to employ some trusty man or men
  to dog and follow them privately, until the fact is ascertained;
  otherwise, it is to be feared, no positive proof of the intention of the
  people engaged in this infamous trade can be obtained.</p>

  <p>"I sincerely wish every practicable plan may be attempted for seizing
  the cattle, apprehending and bringing to condign punishment the men; as
  this would tend essentially to frustrate the insidious schemes of our
  enemies, as well as deter their other agents from similar practices.</p>

<h3>ON A PASSAGE IN THE "DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE OF ENGLAND."&mdash;SURNAMES.</h3>

  <p>In this work, to the justly high character of which I need scarcely
  refer, the "General Remarks" relating to the periods under consideration
  are full of information of the most interesting kind, as they often
  contain illustrations of manners and customs not to be met with
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>In a portion of the "Remarks" illustrative of the thirteenth century,
  showing the difficulty and insecurity of travelling at that time (pp.
  120-122.), there is, however, an incorrect rendering of an extract from
  an original document; and this error seriously affects the "illustration"
  afforded by it. As I am in some degree personally involved in the matter,
  having supplied the material in its original shape, I may perhaps be
  permitted fully to explain and correct the passage. My only regret is,
  that I had not the opportunity of calling my friend's attention to the
  subject before the sheets were finally struck off. The extract is from an
  Account of the Chamberlain of Chester, 29-30 Edw. I., showing how the sum
  of 1000<i>l.</i> was transmitted from Chester to London. After referring
  to the convoy for the treasure:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was not sufficient, however," says the late Mr. Turner, "that the
  money should be protected; in the absence of hostels, except in towns, it
  was necessary to secure the guards from hunger. <i>Therefore they were
  accompanied by two cooks</i>, who provided 'a safe lodging' daily for the
  money; and, as a matter of course, <i>provided for the culinary
  necessities of its conductors</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It will be seen that upon the word rendered "cooks" depends the whole
  value of this passage, <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page279"></a>{279}</span>as evidence of the road-side necessities
  of the period. That word, however, does not bear such a construction;
  although, at first sight, nothing would be more natural than to render it
  so. It is written in the original "cok'," contracted; and to those
  conversant with mediæval Latin, it is known to express
  "cokinus&mdash;coquinus," <i>Gallicè</i> "coquin:" a word derived from
  "coquus," and <i>not</i> that word itself. It occurs commonly enough in
  the Royal Wardrobe Accounts, and means simply "a messenger."<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> For those who
  have not the opportunity of referring to original documents, there is a
  very good account of the persons so designated supplied by the <i>Liber
  quotidianus Contrarotulatoris Garderobæ, anno 28 Edw. I.</i>, edited by
  John Topham, Esq., in 1787, from the original in the library of the
  Society of Antiquaries. It is referred to in the note to the Post Office
  Report as containing the words Cokinus, Nuncius, and Garcio, used
  apparently in one sense. At p. 280. is an account of payments under the
  heading "Titulus de expens' nuncior' et cok' Regis Edwardi," &amp;c., and
  in the glossary this explanation of the word is given:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Cokinus, Coquinus.</span>&mdash;'Homo vilissimus nec
  nisi infimis conquinæ ministeriis natus,' says Ducange. Charpentier adds
  <i>beggar</i>. Here it means the lowest kind of messengers or
  errand-boys, like <i>sculls</i> or <i>scullions</i> in colleges."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But this is too low an estimate of the class.</p>

  <p>Having disposed of this passage, I wish now to draw the attention of
  your readers who have taken part or interest in the late discussion in
  your pages upon certain surnames, to the bearing which this extract, and
  others expressive of the individuals there referred to, has upon that
  numerous series of names ending in "cock;" about which so many, and, for
  these regenerate days, some singular suggestions have been made. The
  discussion was, I believe, commenced in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
  for May, 1837; and, in the number for the same month in the following
  year, J. G. N. suggested that many of those names might be referred to
  forms of "Coc, koc, le coq, which occur in records as abbreviations of
  coquus, cocus&mdash;cook."</p>

  <p>How cavalierly the suggestions thus afforded by Mr. Urban's pages were
  treated by Mr. Lower, your readers will see who refer to the pages of
  that gentleman's work upon <i>English Surnames</i>, indicated in the
  author's last communication to you ("N. &amp;. Q.," Vol. v., p. 509.).
  But their faith in the improvement "N. &amp; Q." has so greatly
  contributed to effect in such matters, will not however let them be
  deterred by the terms there used from pursuing the subject. It will be
  seen that my present contribution will modify the view taken by J. G. N.,
  but also, to a considerable extent, support it.</p>

  <p>I am not aware that any attempt has been made to show how early these
  names were used. I can refer to several instances of the names "Wilcoc"
  or "Willecok," and "Badecok," two complete examples of the kind, in the
  documents of the reign of Edward I.</p>

  <p>Those of your readers who are members of the Camden Society have now
  before them a copy of a document in which the first of those names occurs
  several times. I refer to the small Household Roll of John of Brabant
  while at the English court, which is printed in the last volume of the
  Camden Society's <i>Miscellany</i>.</p>

  <p>No one doubts that by far the greater part of the names in question
  were originally corrupted forms of Christian names, with a suffix. Mr.
  Lower has done good service in showing thus much. And any one who refers
  to the list in the Royal Wardrobe Account of 28 Edw. I., and especially
  those who can also consult other similar manuscripts, will admit that it
  would be quite possible that any Christian name might have been so used;
  so numerous must have been the class of persons called "cokini." I will
  not further trespass upon your space with specimens of names so
  manufactured, as they can be formed with ease upon the first name
  "Wilcoc" from "Wille le cok,"&mdash;the contracting mark being dropped.
  The final letter "k" is of importance, as distinguishing the derivative
  from the parent word "coquus;" from what period, and <i>why</i>, is
  doubtful. That there is but little early documentary evidence of the
  names in their complete state, might be attributed to the inferior class
  of the individuals so designated.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lower's sole explanation of the terminal in question is, that it
  is a diminutive like "kin;" and in justice to that view, I must not pass
  over the evidence afforded by the Brabant Roll of a case where the two
  names seem to be interchanged. One of Prince John's pages is named on the
  roll "Hankin" (p. 7. line 3.); while, on the Wardrobe Account three years
  previous, where the servants are specified by name, "Hancock" is there,
  who is most likely the same person. It will also be seen, that whereas in
  the Wardrobe Account the armourer's name is "Giles," and the barber's
  "Walter" (see notes to the Brabant Roll), the foreign scribe of the
  account dubs them "Gilkin" <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>{280}</span>and "Woterkin." In following up his
  argument upon this subject, Mr. Lower speaks of a person being called
  "Little Wilcock," as an instance of complete tautology: if, however, it
  is meant by this (as it seems to be), that a diminutive name was only
  applied to a diminutive in person, or only expressed such a one, I am
  sure he will find very many differ from him, as affection or familiarity
  was at least as likely to have originated its use. Thus, Peter de
  Gaveston would surely not be deprived of his knightly fame because he was
  called by Prince Edward "Perot" (Pierrote <i>a</i> Pierre). Thus also
  came "Amyot" from Amy, "Launcelot" from Laurence, "Gillot" from Giles.
  And "kin" has as much right to be so considered. But there being already
  these two diminutives in ordinary use as to names of persons, there
  surely was no occasion to apply to the same purpose a syllable which
  (with a mark of contraction) certainly had a direct meaning, and
  expressed a vocation; and which has very rarely been otherwise used in a
  diminutive sense.</p>

  <p>My object is not so much to advocate any particular solution as
  regards these names, as to submit evidence bearing upon the subject, with
  such explanations as have occurred to me.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Report from the Select Committee</i> (of the House of
  Commons) <i>on the Post Office</i> in 1844, Sir F. Palgrave makes the
  following note on the word <i>Cokinus</i>, which occurs in some documents
  supplied to the Committee, and printed in their Appendix:</p>

  <p>"The word <i>Cokinus</i>, in the Wardrobe Accounts of the latter half
  of the thirteenth century, is used to signify a 'messenger;' but in what
  the Cokinus differed from the Nuncius and the Garcio&mdash;the other
  terms employed in their accounts to signify the bearers of letters or
  messages&mdash;does not appear."</p>

<h3>SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.</h3>

  <p>The habit of this celebrated author, to annotate in the margins of
  books which he was reading, must be well known to many of the subscribers
  of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p>I have in my possession a curious little volume of notes, &amp;c. in
  Mr. Coleridge's handwriting, of course very highly prized, from which
  extracts were made in vol. i. pp. 274-5., &amp;c. of Coleridge's
  <i>Literary Remains</i>, collected and edited by his nephew, H. N.
  Coleridge, Esq., 4 vols., 1836: Pickering.</p>

  <p>But, in addition to this volume, I have a few with S. T. Coleridge's
  pencillings in the margins. The following is selected from Dr. Parr's
  celebrated <i>Spital Sermon</i>, and is appended to one of his (Dr.
  Parr's) notes, wherein he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Upon the various effects of superstition, where it has spread widely
  and thriven long, we can reason from facts. But in the original frame of
  the human mind, and in the operation of all those usual causes which
  regulate our conduct or affect our happiness, there seems to be a most
  active, constant, and invincible principle of <i>resistance</i> to the
  approachments of atheism. 'All nature cries aloud' against them, 'through
  all her works,' not in speculation only, but in practice."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Coleridge's annotation upon the foregoing opinion of the learned
  Doctor is as follows; and I select it as a specimen of Coleridge's
  astonishing recollection of any opinions he had formerly promulgated,
  which might have called any laxity of principle, religious, moral, or
  political, into doubt, and of his extreme anxiety to refute or explain
  them:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I never had even a doubt in <i>my being</i> concerning the supreme
  Mind; but understand too sufficiently the difficulty of any intellectual
  demonstrations of his existence, and see too plainly how inevitably the
  principles of many pious men (Locke, Priestley, Hartley, even Archbishop
  King) would lead to atheism by fair production of consequences, not to
  feel in perfect charity with all good men, atheist or theist; and, let me
  add, though I now seem to feel firm ground of <i>reason</i> under my
  belief in God, not gratefully to attribute my uniform past <i>theism</i>
  more to general feeling than to depth of understanding. Within this
  purpose I hope that, without offence, I may declare my conviction, that
  in the French Revolution atheism was an effect, not a cause; that the
  same wicked men, under other circumstances and fashions, would have done
  the same things as Anabaptists within Munster, or as Inquisitors among
  the South American Indians; and that atheism from conviction, and as a
  ruling motive and impulse (in which case only can it be fairly compared
  with superstition), is a quiescent state and <i>per se</i> harmless to
  all but the atheist himself. Rather is it that overwhelming preference of
  experimental philosophy, which, by smothering over more delicate
  perceptions, and debilitating often to impotence the faculty of going
  into ourselves, leads to atheism as a conscious creed, and in its extreme
  is atheism in its essence. This rather is, I should deem, the more
  perilous, and a plainer and better object for philosophical attack. O!
  bring back <i>Jack the Giant Killer</i> and the <i>Arabian Nights</i> to
  our children, and Plato and his followers to new men, and let us have
  chemistry as we have watchmakers or surgeons (I select purposely
  honourable and useful callings), as a <i>division</i> of human labour, as
  worthy profession for a few, not as a glittering master-feature of the
  education of men, women, and children.&mdash;S. T. C."</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>The ancient Custom of Well-flowering.</i>&mdash;At Tissington, near
  Ashbourne, Derbyshire, annually, on Ascension Day, a beautiful ceremony
  called the "well-flowering" takes place; and in it Psalms used by the
  Church of England are partially employed. It is a popular recognition of
  the value of those "perpetual fountains which gush out from below the dry
  wolds and limestone hills, bearing life and beauty on their
  course,&mdash;objects," remarks Professor Phillips in his admirable work
  on <i>The Rivers, Mountains, and Sea Coasts of Yorkshire</i> (recently
  published), "on which rustic love and admiration may tastefully bestow
  the emblematic flowers and grateful songs, which constituted a pleasing
  form of popular worship in the earlier ages of the world." Perhaps some
  correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." may be enabled to mention other <!-- Page
  281 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>{281}</span>villages
  besides Tissington in which this innocent and pleasing custom is still
  observed. I am aware that there are many places, especially in the north
  of England, in which a rustic celebration takes place annually at wells
  sacred from olden time; but is not the "well-flowering" a distinct
  custom?</p>

  <p><i>Devil's Marks in Swine.</i>&mdash;"We don't kill a pig every day,"
  but we did a short time since; and after its hairs were scraped off, our
  attention was directed to six small rings, about the size of a pea, and
  in colour as if burnt or branded, on the inside of each fore leg, and
  disposed curvilinearly. Our labourer informed us with great gravity, and
  evidently believed it, that these marks were caused by the pressure of
  the devil's fingers, when he entered the herd of swine which immediately
  ran violently into the sea.&mdash;See Mark v. 11-15.; Luke viii. 22,
  33.</p>

  <p><i>Festival of Baal.</i>&mdash;The late Lady Baird, of Ferntower, in
  Perthshire, told me that, every year at "Beltane" (or the 1st of May), a
  number of men and women assembled at an ancient druidical circle of
  stones on her property, near Crieff. They light a fire in the centre;
  each person puts a bit of oatcake into a shepherd's bonnet; they all sit
  down and draw blindfold a piece of cake from the bonnet. One piece has
  been previously blackened, and whoever gets that piece has to jump
  through the fire in the centre of the circle and to pay a forfeit. This
  is, in fact, a part of the ancient worship of Baal, and the person on
  whom the lot fell was formerly burnt as a sacrifice; now, the passing
  through the fire represents that, and the payment of the forfeit redeems
  the victim. It is curious that staunch Presbyterians, as the people of
  that part of Perthshire now are, should unknowingly keep up the
  observance of a great heathen festival.</p>

<h3>LORD MONBODDO.</h3>

  <p>In my copy of <i>The Origin and Progress of Language</i>, I have
  recorded a little <span title="anekdoton" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&#x1F73;&kappa;&delta;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span> of
  the author, which is now probably known to nobody but myself, and which
  you may perhaps think worth preservation. It was related to me some
  fifteen years ago, by a learned physician of this city, now deceased, who
  had it from Dr. James Gregory himself.</p>

  <p>It appears that Lord Monboddo, in spite of failing health and very
  advanced age, felt a wish to pay one more visit to the English
  metropolis, in the literary circles of which he was fond of mingling.
  That he had actually set out upon this formidable journey, was known to
  Dr. Gregory, who, being a few hours afterwards at a short distance from
  Edinburgh, was a little surprised to meet his venerable friend returning
  homewards. He was on horseback, equipped in his usual travelling
  costume,&mdash;cocked hat, scarlet <i>roquelaure</i>, and jack-boots, but
  looking extremely ill and depressed in spirits. "What, so soon returned?"
  was Dr. Gregory's exclamation. "Yes," said the old man, "I feel myself
  quite unequal to the journey, and was just thinking of a passage in
  Horace, and adapting it to my own case." "What, 'Solve senescentem?'"
  said the Doctor. "No," replied his lordship, "it is one not quite so
  hackneyed." He then repeated, with much emotion, the following lines from
  the second Satire of the second book:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Seu recreare volet tenuatum corpus; ubique</p>
      <p>Accedent anni, et tractari mollius ætas</p>
      <p>Imbecilla volet."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This was the last time Dr. Gregory saw him out of doors, and he died
  not long after.</p>

<h3>ST. VALENTINE.</h3>

  <p>The subjoined cutting from an American newspaper (<i>Wooster

  complete and perfect assortment of 'Love's Armor' ever before offered to
  the citizens of Wayne County. During the past year the 'Blind God' has

  anything he has heretofore issued. And it is with 'feelinks' of the

  <p>"To those susceptible persons whose hearts were captured during the

  'blessings' descend unto even the third and fourth generations, and it is
  probable that the business will go on increasing year upon year, until

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>His Excellency David Hartley.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i> of January last (which I have only lately seen), there is
  inserted at page 8. a letter signed by "Benjamin Franklin and John Jay,"
  and addressed to His Excellency David Hartley, announcing the arrival in
  Europe of the ratification, by the Congress of the United States, of the
  definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States,
  and stating that they were ready to exchange the ratification with Mr.
  Hartley.</p>

  <p>In a note prefixed to this letter, the editor of the review states
  that Mr. Hartley "then held some other diplomatic appointment from the
  United States."</p>

  <p>Now this is a mistake. Mr. Hartley was the British plenipotentiary who
  signed that treaty at Paris in September, 1783, with the American
  plenipotentiaries, and held no diplomatic appointment from the United
  States. He was therefore the proper person to exchange the ratifications
  with the American plenipotentiaries.</p>

  <p>The treaty is printed at full length in Chalmers' <i>Collection of
  Treaties</i>, together with Mr. Hartley's <i>full power</i> as the
  British plenipotentiary.</p>

  <p><i>The Life and Correspondence of S. T. Coleridge.</i>&mdash;It is
  much to be regretted that no proper life of the "noticeable man" has yet
  appeared. There is no lack of "reminiscences," and "recollections," and
  "conversations," conveying, distorted views of his life and character,
  and exaggerated statements of his faults and failings; but his life has
  yet to be written. And now would be the time, whilst some of his friends
  and cotemporaries are still living, to do justice to his memory. Scott,
  Southey, Wordsworth, have had their lives copiously illustrated, and even
  little Tommy Moore is (<i>cosa stupenda</i>) to have <i>ten volumes</i>
  devoted to his life, whilst Coleridge, the myriad-minded, still waits for
  a biographer. And who would be so suitable as Derwent Coleridge to
  perform the office!</p>

  <p><i>An old Riddle.</i>&mdash;I lately found the following mysterious
  verse upon a scrap of paper. It is of the time of Henry VIII.:</p>

  <p><i>The Word "rather."</i>&mdash;The word <i>rather</i> is, as far as I
  know (if I am wrong, perhaps some of your correspondents will correct me)
  a solitary instance in our language of a comparative regularly formed
  from a positive which is now obsolete. In the <i>Cant. Tales</i>, v.
  13029., we find the positive form:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"What aileth you so <i>rathe</i> for to arise;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>where <i>rathe</i> means "early, soon."</p>

  <p>The earliest use of the comparative degree which I can find, is in a
  piece of Anglo-Norman poetry preserved in Hickes's <i>Thesaurus</i>, and
  given in Ellis's <i>Specimens</i>, vol. i. p. 73.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The chrystal turneth into glass</p>
      <p>In state that it <i>rather</i> was."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here we have the adverbial form; but in Chaucer's <i>Troilus and
  Creseide</i>, iii. 1342., we find the adjectival form:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But now to purpose of my <i>rather</i> speech,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>where, according to the principle laid down by Dr. Latham, in his
  <i>English Language</i>, p. 262., 2nd edit., we should, I suppose,
  pronounce it <i>rayther</i>.</p>

  <p>This word has sustained various modifications of meaning, but they are
  in general easily deducible from the original signification: <i>e.g.</i>
  the phrase "I had <i>rather</i>" is easily explained, as far as the word
  <i>rather</i> is concerned; for that which we do more quickly, we do
  preferably. But in such expressions as "I am <i>rather</i> tired,"
  equivalent to "I am a little tired," the explanation is not so obvious.
  In this case <i>rather</i> seems to mean "In greater degree than
  otherwise." Now, in such sentences as "I am glad you are come, <i>the
  rather</i> that I have work for you to do," <i>rather</i> seems to
  require the signification "in a greater degree;" and may we not therefore
  explain the case in question as an elliptical expression for "rather than
  not?" If <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page283"></a>{283}</span>so, is it not a solitary instance of such
  a construction in our language? Perhaps some of your correspondents can
  inform me, at what period this use of the word was introduced; for it is
  doubtless a modern innovation.</p>

<h3>CORBET PEERAGE.</h3>

  <p>Sarah, widow of Sir Vincent Corbet, Bart., was created (23rd October,
  1679) Viscountess Corbet, of Linchlade, co. Bucks, for her natural life;
  and in the patent the preamble runs,&mdash;that his Majesty Charles
  II.,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Having taken into his royal consideration the great worth and merits
  of the trusty and well-beloved Sarah Lady Corbet, together with the
  faithful services of the late Sir Vincent Corbet, grants," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This evidently explains but little of the real reason both of the
  grant and its limitation. Lady Corbet had, besides four daughters, two
  sons then living: both in turns succeeded to the baronetcy. If the
  peerage were a reward for the services of the late Sir Vincent (those
  services, indeed, consisting in his having been completely routed by Sir
  Will Brereton at Nantwich, and afterwards with six troops of horse taken
  by surprise at Drayton, followed eventually by fine and
  sequestration),&mdash;if, I say, for these services, nineteen years after
  the Restoration, and certainly three after Sir Vincent's own death, the
  peerage were bestowed on his widow, then why was it limited for her life?
  Why was the unusual course taken of actually excluding the succession of
  the issue, who naturally should have been the recipients of the honour?
  We may conclude, therefore, the motive was personal favour, "the great
  worth and merits" of Lady Corbet in fact, as the patent first asserts;
  but then the Query arises what these were. Tradition says Lady Corbet was
  a beauty and a <i>favourite</i> (the term may be understood) at a
  profligate court, and the peerage was the reward; but I cannot discover
  that this is more than tradition, and have never found any corroborative
  authority even among the many scandalous histories of the time, and I am
  most desirous to know if any such evidence can be given.</p>

  <p>It may be as well to add that in 1679 Lady Corbet was <i>sixty-six</i>
  years of age; but we may presume she still had attractions (unless these
  were only her rank) from the fact that two months later she remarried Sir
  Charles Lee of Billesley.</p>

<h3>THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON A MARÉCHAL DE FRANCE.</h3>

  <p>The <i>Revue Britannique</i>, in its Number for November, 1852, under
  the head of "Nouvelles des Sciences," gives an account of the Duke of
  Wellington's funeral, and enumerates the titles of the illustrious
  deceased, as proclaimed on the occasion by Garter King-at-Arms. The
  writer marks in Italics those of <i>Duc de Brunoy en France</i>,
  <i>Maréchal de France</i>, and <i>Chevalier du Saint-Esprit</i>, and then
  appends these remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Que le titre de Duc de Brunoy ait été donné réellement par Louis
  XVIII. à Lord Wellington, c'est croyable. Le roi pouvait créer ce duché
  en sa faveur, sans blesser aucune susceptibilité militaire. Mais que ce
  prince politique ait pu nommer Maréchal de France un général étranger,
  auquel il préférait donner le cordon du Saint-Esprit, plutôt que la
  simple croix de la Légion-d'Honneur, qu'on cherche en vain dans la liste
  des Ordres dont Lord Wellington fut décoré, c'est plus difficile à
  croire, à moins que cette nomination n'ait eu lieu avec des reserves et
  des conditions de secret, qui auraient fort peu satisfait celui qu'on
  supposait, sans doute, ambitieux d'un pareil honneur, puisque on le lui
  offrait. Le nombre des Maréchaux fut limité et non augmenté sous la
  Restoration. Louis XVIII. crea une Maréchale, il est vrai;&mdash;Si Lord
  Wellington fut nommé Maréchal, ce titre, restreint à une qualification
  honorifique, comme celle de la veuve de Moreau, ne put jamais lui
  conférer aucun rang dans l'armée Française. Je somme ici le roi d'armes
  Jarretière de vouloir bien produire le diplôme du noble duc."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>No man ever stood less in need of foreign orders than the Duke of
  Wellington; and no man ever <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>{284}</span>had so many of them conferred upon him. As
  he was the last to assume a title that did not belong to him, so he would
  have been the first to repudiate any such pretension, if put forward by
  others on his behalf. Allow me therefore to ask, Would it be inconsistent
  with what is due to the memory of the great Duke, or with our sense of
  national honour, to undertake the task of clearing up the doubts thus
  thrown out respecting his claim to the title of Maréchal de France? I
  believe these doubts have been repeated in other French journals, and
  that no reply has yet been made to them by the English press.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Prophecy in Hoveden.</i>&mdash;I should be extremely obliged if any
  one of your numerous readers would give me the following information. In
  the account given by Hoveden (p. 678. of the Frankfort edition of Sir H.
  Savile's <i>Scriptores post Bedam</i>) of the proceedings during the stay
  of Richard I. at Messina, that author says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Then was fulfilled the prophecy which was found written in ancient
  characters on tablets of stone, near a vill of the King of England, which
  is called 'Here,' and which King Henry gave to William Fitz-Stephen. Here
  the said William built a new house on a pinnacle, on which he placed the
  figure of a stag, which is supposed to have been done that the said
  prophecy might be fulfilled, which was to the following effect:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>This is evidently full of typographical errors, and may be more
  correctly set forth in the English edition of 1596, which I have not at
  hand. I therefore wish for information on these points:</p>

  <p>1. What is the correct version of this prophecy, and where may it be
  found?</p>

  <p>2. What place is meant by "Here?"</p>

  <p>I need hardly say that I have no difficulty as to the first two lines:
  "When you see a hart reared (erected) in Here, then shall England be

  <p><i>A Skating Problem.</i>&mdash;The motto of your paper is, "When

  <p>In several of my skating excursions I have observed, and noted it to
  others, that ice of just sufficient strength to bear any one in skates
  standing upon it, will instantly break if tried by the same person
  without having skates on. I don't know if any of your readers have made
  the same discovery: if so, can they explain the cause? If, on the
  contrary, any are incredulous enough to doubt the fact, I would recommend
  them to test the truth of my statement by a personal trial, before they
  pass a hasty judgment of the subject.</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Our women batten well on their good nature</p>
      <p>All they can rap and rend for the dear creature."</p>

  </div>

  <p>"All they can rap and run for" is the more frequent colloquial version
  of this quaint phrase.</p>

  <p>In Chaucer's "Chanones Yeman's Tale" it stands thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg3">"But wasten all that ye may rape and renne."</p>
    </div>

  <p>And to this last word Tyrwhit, in his Glossary, gives "rend?" with a
  mark of interrogation, as doubtful of the meaning.</p>

  <p>Johnson gives it "rap and rend," and quotes a line of Hudibras:</p>

  <p><i>Deprived Bishops of Scotland, 1638.</i>&mdash;Neither Bishop Keith,
  with all his industry (in his <i>Hist. Catal. of the Scottish
  Bishops</i>), nor subsequent ecclesiastical writers on the same subject,
  appear to have been able to mention the period of the deaths of nearly
  all those prelates deprived of their sees in 1638. The researches of late
  years may, perhaps, have been more successful, and in that hope I now
  venture to inquire when and where the lives of the following Scottish
  bishops came to a close&mdash;1. David Lindsay, Bishop of Edinburgh. 2.
  Alex. Lindsay, Bishop of Dunkeld. 3. Adam Ballenden, Bishop of Aberdeen.
  4. John Guthrie, Bishop of Moray. 5. James Fairly, Bishop of Argyle. 6.
  Neil Campbell, Bishop of the Isles. 7. John Abernethy, Bishop of
  Caithness. 8. Geo. Graham, Bishop of Orkney; and 9. Robert Baron, Bishop
  elect of Orkney, 1638. The Archbishops of St. Andrew and Glasgow, and
  Bishops of Brechin, Dunblane, Ross, and Galloway, are slightly noticed,
  though even in these few there are discrepancies, both as to year and
  place of demise, which might be corrected. The later ecclesiastical
  records of Scotland are also exceedingly scanty; for Mr. Perceval, with
  all his acumen and research (in his <i>Apology for the Doctrine of
  Apostolical Succession</i>, 2nd edit., Appendix, pp. 250-3.),
  acknowledges with regret his inability to give more particulars of the
  consecrations in Scotland between 1662 and 1688, for the column with
  names of consecrators is without dates of consecrations during that
  period, and is, with very few exceptions, a blank. In continuation of
  this topic, may I inquire when and where the two following bishops,
  deprived in 1690, died?&mdash;1. John Hamilton, Bishop of Dunkeld and 2.
  Archibald Graham, Bishop of the Isles. The notices given by Bishop Keith,
  of the other deprived Scottish bishops, are also exceedingly brief and
  meagre; nor has Mr. Lawson (<i>Hist. Scot. Epis. Ch.</i>) added much.</p>

  dukedom of Hamilton was Anne, daughter of the first and niece of the
  second Duke of Hamilton; and that she married William, Earl of Selkirk,

  <p><i>Denmark and Slavery.</i>&mdash;Dr. Madden, in <i>A Twelve Months'

  enter into the slave trade, and the first to abandon it, "This is
  inaccurate: to the honour of Denmark be it spoken, the slave trade was
  abolished by her five years before England performed that act of tardy
  justice to humanity" (vol. ii. p. 128.). The object of the present

  <p><i>Bishop Francis Turner.</i>&mdash;He left a manuscript Life of
  Nicholas Ferrar of Little Gidding, which formed the basis of Dr.
  Peckard's <i>Life of Ferrar</i>, reprinted in Wordsworth's
  <i>Ecclesiastical Biography</i>. Where can this manuscript be found? Are
  there any literary remains of the bishop to be met with anywhere?</p>

  <p class="author">J. J. J.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We believe all that is known of Bishop Turner's MS. Life of Nicholas
  Ferrar is, that it was in the custody of the editor of <i>The Christian
  Magazine</i> in 1761. Foster the Essayist (<i>Lectures</i>, vol. ii. p.
  504. edit. 1848) says, "A long and well-written account of Ferrar was
  drawn up by a Dr. Turner, Bishop of Ely, and left by him in manuscript.
  It remained in the hands of the persons to whom his papers descended,
  till it was communicated to the conductors of a miscellany called <i>The
  Christian Magazine</i>, in a volume of which for the year 1761, this
  curious memoir was lately pointed out to me." Gough, in his <i>British
  Topography</i>, vol. ii. p. 299.*, furnishes a few other
  particulars:&mdash;"The papers of Bishop Turner, in the year 1761, appear
  to have been in the hands of Dr. Dodd, who printed some of them in <i>The
  Christian Magazine</i> for that year. In particular the <i>Life of Mr.
  Nicholas Ferrar</i> was abridged, and published at p. 356. In the
  introduction the editor says, 'As the <i>Life</i> is rather too long for
  our pamphlet, even divided, we have taken the liberty to abridge some
  particulars in the Bishop's account, and now and then to alter a phrase
  or two in his language, which through length of time is in some places
  rather become obsolete.' From this passage it will appear that it was
  published in the worst manner it could be." Our correspondent will find
  much curious matter respecting the biographies of Nicholas Ferrar in our
  Second Volume, pp. 119. 407. 444. 485. Among the Addit. MSS. (No. 5540.,
  f. 53.) in the British Museum, is a Letter of Bishop Turner's addressed

<h3>EPITAPHS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 178.)</p>

  <p>The following is a <i>real</i> epitaph. It was written by Dr.
  Greenwood on his wife, who died in childbed, and it is in all probability
  still to be seen, where it was originally set up, in Solyhull churchyard,
  Warwickshire. The most amusing point in it is, that the author seriously
  intended the lines to rhyme. There is wonderful merit in the couplet
  where he celebrates her courage and magnanimity in preferring him to a
  lord or judge:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Which heroic action, join'd to all the rest,</p>
      <p>Made her to be esteem'd the Ph&oelig;nix of her sex!"</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Go, cruel Death, thou hast cut down</p>
      <p>The fairest Greenwood in all this kingdom!</p>
      <p>Her virtues and her good qualities were such</p>
      <p>That surely she deserved a lord or judge:</p>
      <p>But her piety and great humility</p>
      <p>Made her prefer me, a Doctor in Divinity;</p>
      <p>Which heroic action, join'd to all the rest,</p>
      <p>Made her to be esteem'd the Ph&oelig;nix of her sex:</p>
      <p>And like that bird a young she did create,</p>
      <p>To comfort those her loss had made disconsolate.</p>
      <p>My grief for her was so sore</p>
      <p>That I can only utter two lines more.</p>
      <p>For this and all other good woman's sake,</p>

<h3>THROWING OLD SHOES FOR LUCK.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ii., p. 196.; Vol. v., p. 143.; Vol. vii., p. 182.)</p>

  <p>Some light may perhaps be thrown on this mysterious custom by the
  following quotation from the <i>Réfutation des Opinions de Jean Wier</i>,
  by Bodin, the celebrated French jurisconsult, and author of the
  <i>Demonomanie des Sorciers</i> (Paris, 1586), to the quarto edition of
  which the <i>Réfutation</i> is generally found attached. It may be
  necessary to observe, for the benefit of those unacquainted with
  demoniacal lore, that Wier, though a pupil of Cornelius Agrippa, and what
  would be now-a-days termed exceedingly superstitious, was far in advance
  of his age, and the first to assert that some, at least, of the many
  persons who were then burned for sorcery were merely hypochondriacs and
  lunatics,&mdash;fitter subjects for the care of the physician than the
  brand of the executioner. This <i>heterodox</i> opinion brought upon him
  a crowd of antagonistic replies, and amongst them the <i>Réfutation</i>
  of Bodin. During a cursory examination of Wier's voluminous demonological
  works (<i>De Lamiis Liber</i>; <i>Item de Commentatiis Jejuniis</i>;
  <i>De Præstigiis Demonum, et Incantationibus ac Veneficiis</i>: Basil,
  1583), I have not met with the passage underneath referred to by Bodin;
  but, no doubt, if time permitted, a closer search would discover it:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Il se mocque aussi d'une Sorciere, à qui Sathan commanda de garder
  bien ses vieux souliers, pour un preservatif, et contre-charme contre les
  autre Sorciers. Je dy que ce conseil de Sathan a double sens, les
  souliers signifient les pechez, comme estas tousiours trainnez par les
  ordures. Et quand Dieu dist à Moyse et à Josué, oste tes souliers, ce
  lieu est pur, et sainct: il entendoit, comme dict Philon Hebrieu, qu'il
  faut bien nettoyer son ame de peches, pour contempler et louer Dieu. Mais
  pour converser avec Sathan, il faut estre souillé, et plongé en
  perpetuelle impietez et mechancetez: alors Sathan assistera à ses bons
  serviteurs. Et quand aux sens literal, nous avons dict que Sathan fait ce
  qu'il peut, pour destourner les hommes de la fiance de Dieu aux
  creatures, qui est la vraye definition de l'idolatrie, que les
  Theologiens ont baillie: tellement que qui croira, que ses vieux
  souliers, ou les bilets, et autres babioles qu'il porte, le peut garder

  pourtrayed barefooted; and there is not, I believe, a single statue to be
  found of a sandaled Venus. I can certainly direct his Lordship to one
  author, a Christian author, St. Gregory of Tours, who refers to a curious
  practice, and seemingly one well recognised, of lovers presenting
  <i>shoes</i>, as they now do <i>bouquets</i>, to the objects of their
  affection:</p>

  <p>Allow me to inform <span class="sc">Lord Braybrooke</span> that the
  custom of throwing a shoe, taken from the left foot, after persons for
  good luck, has been practised in Norfolk from time immemorial, not only
  at weddings, but on all occasions where good luck is required. Some forty
  years ago a cattle dealer desired his wife to "trull her left shoe arter
  him," when he started for Norwich to buy a lottery-ticket. As he drove
  off on his errand, he looked round to see if she performed the charm, and
  consequently he received the shoe in his face, with such force as to
  black his eyes. He went and bought his ticket, which turned up a prize of
  600<i>l.</i>; and his son has assured me that his father always
  attributed his luck to the extra dose of shoe which he got.</p>

  <p class="author">E. G. R.</p>

  <p>The custom of throwing an old shoe after a person departing from home,
  as a mode of wishing him good luck and prosperity in his undertaking, is
  not confined to Scotland and the northern counties, nor to weddings. It
  prevails more or less, I believe, throughout the kingdom. I have seen it
  in Cheshire, and frequently in towns upon the sea-coast. I once received
  one upon my shoulder, at Swansea, which was intended for a young sailor
  leaving his home to embark upon a trading voyage.</p>

<h3>OWEN GLYNDWR [OWEN AP GRIFFITH VYCHAN, LORD OF GLYNDWRDWY].</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 205.)</p>

  <p>The arms referred to by <span class="sc">Mr. Woodward</span> are those
  on the great seal and privy seal of "the irregular and wild Glendower,"
  as Prince of Wales, <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page289"></a>{289}</span>attached to two documents deposited in the
  Hotel Soubise, at Paris, in the Cartons I. 623. and I. 392., relating, it
  is supposed, to the furnishing of troops to the Welsh prince by Charles
  VI., king of France. Casts of these seals were taken by the indefatigable
  Mr. Doubleday, to whom the Seal department of the British Museum, over
  which he presides, is so much indebted; and impressions were exhibited by
  Sir Henry Ellis at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries, on the 12th
  of December, 1833. Engravings of them, accompanied by the following
  notice, were communicated by Sir Henry to the <i>Archæologia</i>, and
  will be found in that publication, vol. xxv. plate lxx. fig. 2, 3. page
  616., and ibid. pp. 619, 620.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The great seal has an obverse and reverse. On the obverse Owen is
  represented, with a bifid beard, very similar to Rich. II., seated under
  a canopy of Gothic tracery: the half body of a wolf forming the arms of
  his chair on each side: the background is ornamented with a mantle semée
  of lions, held up by angels. At his feet are two lions. A sceptre is in
  his right hand, but he has no crown. The inscription: '<span
  class="sc">Owenus ... Princeps Wallie</span>.' On the reverse of the
  great seal Owen is represented on horseback, in armour; in his right
  hand, which is extended, he holds a sword, and with his left his shield,
  charged with, Quarterly, four lions rampant; a drapery, probably a
  <i>kerchief de plesaunce</i>, or handkerchief won at a tournament,
  pendant from his right wrist. Lions rampant also appear upon the mantle
  of the horse. On his helmet, as well as on his horse's head, is the Welsh
  dragon [passant]. The area of the seal is diapered with roses. The
  inscription on this side seems to fill the gap upon the obverse '<span
  class="sc">Owenus Dei gratia ... Wallie</span>.'</p>

  <p>"The privy seal represents the four lions rampant towards the
  spectator's left, on a shield, surmounted by an open coronet [crown]: the
  dragon<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> of
  Wales, as a supporter, on the dexter side; on the sinister, a lion. The
  inscription seems to have been '<i>Sigillum Oweni</i> <span
  class="sc">Principis Wallie</span>.' No impression of this seal is
  probably now to be found either in Wales or England. Its workmanship
  shows that Owen Glyndwr possessed a taste for art beyond the types of the
  seals of his predecessors."</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The dragon and lion have been attributed to the Welsh monarchs, as
  insignia, from an early period, and the former is ascribed,
  traditionally, to the great Cadwallader.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xx. p. 579. plate xxix. p. 578., are
  descriptions of engravings of the impressions of two seals appendant to
  charters of Edward, son of Edward IV., and Arthur, son of Henry VII., as
  Princes of Wales, the obverse of each bearing three lions in pale
  passant, reguardant, having their tails between their legs, reflected
  upon their backs, upon a shield <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page290"></a>{290}</span>surmounted by a cap of maintenance: Prince
  Edward's shield has on each side a lion as a supporter, holding single
  feathers, with the motto "Ich dien." On Prince Arthur's seal, the
  feathers are supported by <i>dragons</i>. Thomas William King, Rouge
  Dragon, in a letter to Sir Samuel Meyrick, dated 4th September, 1841,
  published in the <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xxix. p. 408., Appendix,
  regards the lions on these shields as to the ensigns attributed at the
  period of the seals to certain Welsh princes, and the dragon as the badge
  of Cadwallader.</p>

  <p>In a MS. (for reference to which I am indebted to the courtesy of Sir
  Frederick Madden), which was recently sold at Sotheby's, containing
  translations by Johannes Boerius, presented to Henry, Prince of Wales,
  son of Henry VII., about 1505, there is a beautiful illumination
  containing the arms of that prince: Quarterly France and England, with
  the red dragon as the dexter, and the greyhound of the House of York as
  the sinister, supporter.</p>

  <p><b>"The red fierye drag&#x14D; beeten up&#x14D; white and greene
  sarcenet"</b> was the charge of a standard offered by Henry VII. at St.
  Paul's, on his entry into London after his victory at Bosworth Field; and
  this standard was represented on the corner of his tomb, held by an angel
  (Willement's <i>Regal Heraldry</i>, 4to., London, 1821, p. 57.). The red
  dragon rampant was assumed as a supporter by Henry VII. in indication of
  his Welsh descent, and was borne as a supporter, either on the dexter or
  sinister side of the shield, by all the other English monarchs of the
  House of Tudor, with the exception of Queen Mary, who substituted for it
  an eagle: and among the badges attributed to our present sovereign is, in
  respect of Wales, "a dragon passant, wings elevated gu., upon a mount
  vert."</p>

  <p>It may be assumed, with little doubt, that the colour of the dragon
  borne by Owen Glyndwr was <i>rouge</i>; and although the colour of the
  other supporter of his shield, the lion, is not susceptible of such
  positive inference, it may be conjectured to have been <i>sable</i>, the
  colour of the lion, the principal charge on his hereditary shield.</p>

  <p>To <span class="sc">Mr. Woodward's</span> immediate Query as to the
  blazon&mdash;colour of the field and charges&mdash;of the arms on these
  seals, I can afford no direct answer, never having met with any trace of
  these arms in the extensive collections of Welsh MSS. to which I have had
  access. These ensigns may have been adopted by Owen as arms of
  <i>dominion</i> (as those of Ireland by the English sovereigns) on his
  assumption of the principality of Wales, a suggestion countenanced, if
  not established, by four lions quarterly ("Quarterly gules and or, four
  lions rampant, counterchanged") being assigned to Griffith ap Llewelyn
  (killed April, 28 Hen. III., 1244, in attempting to escape from the
  Tower), eldest son of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, prince of Wales (dead 31st
  November, 25 Hen. III., 1240), father of the ill-fated and gallant
  Llewelyn ap Griffith, last sovereign of Wales, slain at Builth, December
  10, 8 Ed. I., 1282. Further confirmation is, perhaps, afforded to this
  suggestion by Owen having, it is understood, vindicated his assumption of
  the Cambrian throne as heir of the three sovereign dynasties of North
  Wales, South Wales, and Powys respectively,&mdash;of the last, as male
  representative, through the Lords of Bromfield, of Madoc ap Meredith, the
  last monarch of that principality; and of the two former as their
  heir-general, in respect of his mother, Elenor, sister of Owen (ap Thomas
  ap Llewelyn), Lord, with his paternal uncle, Owen ap Llewelyn ap Owen, of
  the comot [hundred] of Iscoed, September 20, 1344, Representative
  paternally of the sovereigns of South Wales, and, by female descent, of
  those of North Wales<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, through Griffith ap Llewelyn above
  named.</p>

  <p>The hereditary arms of Owen's paternal line, the Lords of Glyndwrdwy,
  are those of his ancestor, Griffith Maelor ap Madoc, of Dinas Bran, Lord
  of Bromfield, Yale, Chirk, Glyndwrdwy, &amp;c., who died <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1191, viz. "Paly of eight argent and gules, over
  all a lion rampant sable," thus differenced, apparently, from "The Black
  Lion of Powys" (Argent a lion rampant sable), the royal ensigns of his
  father, Madoc ap Meredith, last sovereign Prince of Powys, who died at
  Winchester in 1160. I am unable to refer to any seal of the Lords of
  Glyndwrdwy, or of the Lords of Bromfield, bearing the family arms of
  their line; but they are thus given invariably by the Cambrian heralds,
  and, so far, are susceptible of proof by the most authentic MS.
  authorities of the Principality. It is, however, remarkable, that the
  Heraldic Visitations of Wales of Lewis Dwnn, appointed in 1580
  Deputy-Herald for all Wales, by Robert Cook Clarenceux, and William
  Flower Norroy King-at Arms, published in 1846 by the Welsh MSS. Society,
  contain no pedigree of the house of Glyndwrdwy. Of the descendants, if
  any, of Owen Glyndwr himself, beyond his children, I am not aware that
  there is any authentic pedigree, or other satisfactory proof; and there
  seems to be presumptive evidence that in 12 Henry VI., 1433&mdash;a
  period so recent as nineteen years from the last date, 19th February, 1
  Henry V., 1414, on which Owen is ascertained to have been alive (Rymer's
  <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, ix. p. 330.),&mdash;his issue was limited to a
  daughter and heir, <!-- Page 291 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page291"></a>{291}</span>Alice, wife of Sir John Scudamore, Knt.,
  described in a petition of John, Earl of Somerset, to whom Owen's
  domains, on his attainder, had been granted by his brother, Henry IV.,
  as</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Un John Skydmore, Chivaler, et Alice sa femme, pretendantz la dite
  Alice etre file <i>et heir</i> au dit Owyn (Glyndwr)."&mdash;<i>Rot.

</blockquote>

  <p>I have not found evidence to show that there were any children of
  Alice's marriage with Scudamore; and, assuming the failure of her issue,
  and also the extinction of Owen's other offspring, the representation of
  the three dynasties&mdash;</p>

  <p>reverted to that of his only brother, Tudor ap Griffith Vychan, a
  witness, as "Tudor de Glyndore," in the Scrope and Grosvenor controversy,
  3rd September, 1386, and then twenty-four years and upwards, who is
  stated to have been killed under Owen's banner at the battle of Mynydd
  Pwll-Melyn, near Grosmont, Monmouthshire, fought 11th March, 1405.
  Tudor's daughter and heir, Lowry [Lady] of Gwyddelwern in Edeirnion, "una
  Baron. de Edurnyon," became the wife of Griffith ap Einion of Corsygedol,
  living 1400 and 1415; and from this marriage descend the eminent
  Merionethshire House of Corsygedol (represented by the co-heirs of the
  late Sir Thomas Mostyn, Bart., of Mostyn and Corsygedol; namely, his
  nephew, the Honorable Edward Mostyn Lloyd Mostyn, of Mostyn and
  Corsygedol, M.P., Lord Lieutenant of Merionethshire, and Sir Thomas's
  sister, Anna Maria, Lady Vaughan, mother of Sir Robert Williames Vaughan,
  Bart., of Nannau) and its derivative branches, the Yales of Plas-yn-Yale,
  co. Denbigh, and the Rogers-Wynns of Bryntangor in the same county; the
  former represented by the Lloyds of Plymog, and the latter by the
  Hughes's of Gwerclas in Edeirnion, Lords of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, co.
  Merioneth, and Barons of Edeirnion. These families, co-representatives of
  the three Cambrian dynasties, all quarter, with the arms of South Wales
  and North Wales, the ensigns I have referred to as the hereditary
  bearings of the Lords of Glyndwrdwy. Independently of the adoption of
  these ensigns in the Welsh MSS. in the British Museum, College of
  Heralds, and other depositories, it may be mentioned that they are
  quartered in an ancient shield of the Vaughans of Corsygedol, suspended
  in the hall of Corsygedol,&mdash;one of the finest and most picturesque
  mansions in the Principality,&mdash;and that they appear in the splendid
  emblazoned Genealogy of the House of Gwerclas, compiled in 1650 by Robert
  Vaughan, Esq., of Hengwrt, the Camden and Dugdale united of Wales.<a
  name="footnotetag7" href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The arms in
  question are ascribed to the line of Bromfield and Glyndwrdwy, and, as
  quarterings to the families just named, by Mr. Burke's well-known
  <i>Armory</i>, the first and, indeed, only work, in conjunction with the
  Welsh genealogies in that gentleman's <i>Peerage and Baronetage</i>, and
  <i>Landed Gentry</i>, affording satisfactory, or any approach to
  systematic and complete, treatment of Cambrian heraldry and family
  history. Mr. Charles Knight also, highly and justly estimated, no less
  for a refined appreciation of our historic archæology, than for careful
  research, adopts these arms as the escutcheon of Owen in the beautiful
  artistic designs which adorn and illustrate the First Part of the drama
  of <i>King Henry IV.</i>, in his Pictorial edition of Shakspeare.
  (<i>Histories</i>, vol. i. p. 170.)</p>

  <p>The shield of the Lords of Glyndwrdwy, as marshalled by Welsh heralds,
  displays quarterly the arms assigned to their direct paternal ancestors,
  as successively adopted previous to the period when armorial bearings
  became hereditary. Thus marshalled, the paternal arms of Owen Glyndwr are
  as follows: 1st and 4th, "Paly of eight, argent and gules, over all a
  lion rampant sable," for Griffith Maelor, Lord of Bromfield, son of Madoc
  ap Meredith, Prince of Powys-Fadog; 2nd, "Argent, a lion rampant sable"
  ("The Black Lion of Powys") for Madoc, Prince of Powys-Fadog, son of
  Meredith, Prince of Powys, son of Bleddyn, King of Powys; 3rd, "Or, a
  lion rampant gules," for Bleddyn ap Cyfnfyn, King of Powys.<a
  name="footnotetag8" href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> None <!-- Page
  292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>{292}</span>of these
  ensigns is referable to a period anterior to that within which armorial
  bearings are attributed to the Anglo-Norman monarchs.</p>

  <p>The lion rampant is common to all branches of the line of Powys; but
  the bearing peculiar to its last monarch, Madoc ap Meredith, "The
  <i>Black</i> Lion of Powys," without a difference, has been transmitted
  exclusively to the Hughes's, Baronial Lords of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, and
  the other descendants of Owen Brogyntyn, Lord of Edeirnion, younger son
  of Madoc; of whom, with the exception of the family just named, it is
  presumed there is no existing male branch. The same arms were borne by
  Iorwerth Goch, Lord of Mochnant, also a younger son of Madoc; but they
  are now only borne subordinately in the second quarter by that chief's
  descendant, Sir John Roger Kynaston of Hardwick, Bart., and by the other
  branches of the Kynastons; the first quarter having been yielded to the
  arms of (Touchet) Lord Audley, assumed by Sir Roger Kynaston of Hordley,
  Knt., after the battle of Blore in 1459, at which Lord Audley is said to
  have fallen by the hand of Sir Roger. As already stated, Griffith Maelor,
  Madoc's eldest son, bore the black lion differenced, as did also the twin
  sons of the latter, viz. Cynric Efell, Lord of Eglwys Egle, ancestor of
  the distinguished line of Davies of Gwysaney in Flintshire, whose ensigns
  were "Gules, on a bend, argent, a lion passant sable;" and Einion Efell,
  progenitor of the Edwards's of Ness Strange, and of other North Wallian
  families, who bore "Party per fess, sable and argent, a lion rampant
  counterchanged." The ancestor of the Vaughans of Nannau,
  Barts.,&mdash;Cadwgan (designated by Camden "the renowned Briton"),
  younger son of Blyddyn, king of Powys, sometime associated in the
  sovereignty with his elder brother Meredith, exhibited, it is stated, on
  his banner an azure lion on a golden ground; ensigns transmitted to the
  early Lords of Nannau and their descendants, with the
  exception&mdash;probably the only one&mdash;of the Vaughans of Wengraig
  and Hengwrt, represented paternally by the Vaughans of Nannau and
  Hengwrt, Baronets, who, transferring these arms to the second quarter,
  bear in the first, "Quarterly, or and gules, four lions rampant
  counterchanged." The Wenwynwyn branch of the dynasty of Powys continued,
  or at a later period resumed, the red lion rampant on a gold ground,
  ascribed to Blyddyn ap Cynfyn; and it is not a little interesting, that
  recently a beautiful silver seal, in perfect preservation, of Hawys
  Gadarn, heiress of that princely line, who by the gift of Edward II.
  became the wife of John de Cherlton, was found near Oswestry,
  representing her standing, holding two shields: the one in her right hand
  charged with her own arms, the lion rampant; that in the left with those
  of Cherlton, two lions passant. The legend around the seal is "<span
  class="sm">S'HAWISIE DNE DE KEVEOLOC</span>."</p>

  <p>The original seal is now in the Museum of Chester, and was exhibited,
  I believe, by the Honorary Curator, the Rev. William Massie, at a recent
  meeting of the Society of Antiquaries. Of this venerable relic I possess
  an impression in wax; and of the great and privy seals of Owen Glyndwr,
  beautiful casts in sulphur; and I shall have pleasure in leaving them
  with the editor of "N. &amp; Q." for the inspection of <span

  <p>Of this celebrated antiquary, the author of <i>British Antiquities

  Archbishop Ussher, Selden, Sir Simon d'Ewes, Sir John Vaughan, &amp;c.,
  it is observed in the <i>Cambrian Register</i>, "In genealogy he was so
  skilled, and his knowledge on that subject derived from such genuine
  sources, that Hengwrt became the Heralds' College of the Principality,
  and no pedigree was current until it had obtained his sanction."</p>

  <p>His MSS. and library, formerly at Hengwrt, have been transferred to
  Rûg in Edeirnion, the present seat of his descendant, Sir Robert Vaughan
  of Nannau; and it may be confidently stated, that in variety, extent,
  rarity, and value, they surpass any existing collection, public or
  private, of documents relating to the Principality. Many of them are
  unique, and indispensable for the elucidation of Cambrian literature and
  antiquities; and their possessor, by entrusting, to some gentleman
  competent to the task, the privilege of preparing a catalogue
  <i>raisonnée</i> of them, would confer a public benefit which could not
  be too highly appreciated.</p>

  <p>To the noble collections of Gloddaeth, Corsygedol, and Mostyn, now

  <p>The golden lion on a red field may have been displayed on the standard
  of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, but, from analogy to the arms assigned to the
  English monarchs of a corresponding period, it can, as armorial bearings,
  be only regarded, it is apprehended, as attributive. Of the armorial
  bearings of the English monarchs of the House of Normandy, if any were
  used by them, we are left totally without contemporary evidences. The
  arms of William the Conqueror, which have been for ages attributed to him
  and the two succeeding monarchs, are taken from the cornice of Queen
  Elizabeth's monument, in the north aisle of Henry VII.'s Chapel at
  Westminster. The arms assigned to Stephen are adopted on the authority of
  Nicholas Upton, in his treatise <i>De Militari Officio</i>, b. iv. p.
  129., printed in 1654. For those of Henry II., there is no earlier

<h3>COLERIDGE'S CHRISTABEL&mdash;"CHRISTOBELL, A GOTHIC TALE."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 206.).</p>

  <p>Your correspondent S. Y. ought not to have charged the editors of
  Coleridge's <i>Poems</i> with negligence, until he had shown that the
  lines he quotes were inserted in the original edition of
  <i>Christabel</i>. They have not the musical flow of Coleridge's
  versification, but rather the dash and vivacity of Scott. At all events,
  they are not to be found in the second edition of <i>Christabel</i>
  (1816), nor in any subsequent edition. Indeed, I do not think that
  Coleridge made any alteration in the poem since its composition in 1797
  and 1800. I referred to two reviews of Coleridge's <i>Poems</i> published
  in Blackwood in 1819 and 1834; but found no trace of S. Y.'s lines. "An
  old volume of Blackwood" is rather a vague mode of reference. It is
  somewhat curious that, previous to the publication of <i>Christabel</i>,
  there appeared a <i>conclusion</i> to that splendid fragment. It was
  entitled "Christobell, a Gothic Tale," and was published in the
  <i>European Magazine</i> for April, 1815. It is dated "March, 1815," and
  signed "V.;" and was reprinted in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for January,
  1835. It is stated to be "written as a sequel to a beautiful legend of a
  fair lady and her father, deceived by a witch in <!-- Page 293 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>{293}</span>the guise of a noble
  knight's daughter." It commences thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Whence comes the wavering light which falls</p>
      <p>On Langdale's lonely chapel-walls?</p>

      <p>Lies in that lone and drear chapelle."</p>
    </div>

  and impotent conclusion to <i>Christabel</i>, remarks that&mdash;</p>

  <p>Query: Who was this "ingenious writer?"</p>

  <p>S. Y. is "severe <i>over</i> much" and <i>under</i> informed, in his
  strictures on the editors of Coleridge's <i>Works</i> (1852), when he
  blames them for not giving Coleridge the credit of lines which <i>did not
  belong to him</i>. The lines which S. Y. quotes, and a "great many
  more,"&mdash;in fact, a "third part of <i>Christabel</i>,"&mdash;were
  sent to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> in 1820, by the late Dr. William
  Maginn, as a first fruits of those <i>imitations</i> and <i>parodies</i>
  for which he afterwards became so famous. The success of his imitation of
  Coleridge's style is proved by the indignation of your correspondent. It
  is no small honour to the memory and talents of the gifted but erratic
  Maginn, that the want of his lines should be deemed a defect or omission
  in "one of the most beautiful poems in the English language." But in
  future, before he condemns editors for carelessness, S. Y. should be sure
  that he himself is correct.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Economical Way of Iodizing Paper.</i>&mdash;The extravagant price
  of the salt called iodide of potassium has led me to experiments as to
  whether paper could not be iodized in another form; and having been
  successful, I offer the process to the readers of "N. &amp; Q." Having
  verified it three times, I can safely say that it is quite as effectual
  as using the above salt.</p>

  <p>The first solution to be made, is a saturated solution of iodine. Put
  about sixty grains of iodine (the quantity is not of importance) into an
  ounce bottle, and add proof spirits of wine; set it near the fire "on the
  hob;" and when it is nearly boiling, agitate, and it will soon become a
  concentrated essence: take now a bottle of clear glass, called a quart
  bottle, and put in it about two ounces of what is called carbonate of
  potash (nothing more than purified pearlash); fill up with water to
  within an inch of the neck, and agitate; when it is dissolved, add any of
  the other approved sensitives, in discretionable doses, such as fluoride
  or bromide of potassa, ammoniac salt, or common salt&mdash;it may have
  about sixty grains of the latter; and when all are dissolved, add the
  iodine. This is added by degrees, and shaken; and when it is a pale
  yellow, it may be considered to be ready for iodizing: from some
  experiments, I am led to believe that a greater quantity of iodine may,
  if necessary, be added, only the colour should not be dark. And should
  the operator reach this point, a few drops of solution of cyanide of
  potassium may be added, until the pale colour returns. Bromine water I
  believe may be added, but that I have not used hitherto, and therefore
  cannot answer for its effects. The paper then having its usual wash of
  nitrate of silver, is then floated on the solution about one minute, and
  the accustomed process gone through as described by most photographers.
  It is only disposed to require a pretty strong solution of silver, say
  thirty grains to the ounce of water. This I attribute to the potash being
  in a little more caustic condition than when recrystallised with iodine.
  And the only difference in the above formula between the two states is,
  that the iodine in the medical preparation is incorporated by means of
  iron filings with the water, which I only interpret into being a cheaper
  method; which makes its high price the more scandalous, and I hope this
  method will save photographers from the imposition: the price of a quart
  of iodide of potassium would be about six shillings, by the above about
  ten-pence. And I can safely say, it is quite as effectual: theoretically,
  it appears to be better, because iodine is exceedingly difficult to
  preserve after being dissolved and recrystallised. And much of it is lost
  in the preparing iodized paper: as, for instance, the usual way generally
  requires floating on free iodine at the last; and with the formula here
  given, after using once, some small quantity of tincture of iodine should
  be added before putting away, as the silver laid upon the surface of the
  paper absorbs more of the iodine than the potash. Therefore, a very pale
  yellow may be its usual test for efficiency, and the equivalent will be
  maintained.</p>

  <p>N.B.&mdash;Potash varying much in its alkaline property, some samples
  will remain colourless with addition of iodine; in which case the
  judgment must guide as to the quantity of iodine. It should not exceed
  the ounce of tincture: about two drachms may be added after using it for
  paper.</p>

  <p><i>Queries on Sir W. Newton's Process.</i>&mdash;The process of <span
  class="sc">Sir W. Newton</span> is nearly similar to one I have
  successfully used for some years, and I can recommend it as effective and
  simple.</p>

  <p>A difficulty I have lately found, has been with my iodized paper,
  which, when freshly used, is well enough; but if kept a month or two,
  will only allow of the paper being prepared to take views just before
  using. I should much like to know how this occurs.</p>

  <p>If <span class="sc">Sir W. Newton</span> would answer the following
  Queries, he would add to the obligations that many others besides myself
  are under to him:</p>

  <p>1. What paper does he use for positives, and what for negatives?</p>

  <p>2. Is it not better to dissolve the silver and iodide of potassium in
  three ounces of water each instead of one (see "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii.,
  pp. 151. 277.)?</p>

  <p>3. Is spring water fit for washing the iodized paper; if it contains
  either sulphate or bicarbonate of lime or muriate of soda?</p>

  <p>4. How long ought the iodized paper to keep good?</p>

  <p>5. How long should the negative paper (on a moderately warm day) keep
  after being made sensitive, before exposing to the action of light; and
  how soon after that should it be developed?</p>

  <p><i>Suggestion to Photographers.</i>&mdash;The Rev. Charles Forster, in
  his <i>One Primeval Language</i> (p. 96.), speaks of the desirableness of
  obtaining copies of two great inscriptions in the Djebel
  Mokatteb,&mdash;one in forty-one, the other in sixty-seven lines,
  supposed to have been written by the Israelites during their exode. In
  the words, however, of the Comte d'Antraigues, which he quotes in p. 84:
  "Il faudroit six mois d'un travail opiniâtre, pour dessiner la totalité
  de ces caractères." Is not this a temptation to some of your photographic
  friends, who may be turning their steps to the East during the ensuing
  season, to possess themselves of a treasure which by the application of
  their art they might acquire almost in as many minutes?</p>

  <p><i>Portrait of Pope</i> (Vol. vii., p. 180.).&mdash;I cannot at this

  perhaps can correct an error in it. There was no <i>White</i> of Derby;
  but Edward<a name="footnotetag9" href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>

  my possession a portrait of Pope done by him. On the back of this
  portrait is the following inscription:</p>

  <p>"Edward Wright, the painter of this picture, was an intimate friend of
  Mr. Richardson, and obtained leave from him to copy the portrait of Mr.

  dinner, and on mentioning to him how he was employed, Mr. Pope said: 'Why
  should you take a copy, when the original is at your service? I will come
  and sit to you.' He did so, and this picture was finished from Mr. Pope
  himself. This account I had from the late William Wright, Esq., my
  honoured uncle, who had the picture from the painter himself. At Mr.

  <p><i>Curious Fact in Natural Philosophy</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  206.).&mdash;In Young's <i>Natural Philosophy</i> it is said, that if the
  cup of a barometer is placed in a vessel somewhat larger than the cup, so
  contrived that the tube of the barometer may fit air-tight in the top of
  the vessel, and if two holes are made in the vessel on opposite sides, a
  current of air driven in at one hole will cause the mercury to fall. Is
  not the case of the cards analogous to this? and might not the cause be,
  that the current of air carries away with it some of that contained
  between the cards, and so that the air is sufficiently rarefied to cause
  a pressure upwards greater than that caused by the current downwards, and
  the effect of gravity? Might not the sudden fall of the barometer before
  storms be from a cause similar in some degree to this?</p>

  <p>"<i>Haud cum Jesu itis, qui itis cum Jesuitis.</i>"&mdash;In "N. &amp;
  Q." for Feb. 7, 1852, a correspondent, L. H. J. T., asks for some clue to
  the above. Last March a friend of mine purchased in Paris, at a
  book-stall on the Quai D'Orsay, a manuscript book, very beautifully
  written, and in the old binding of the time, which appears to be the
  transcript of a printed volume. Its title is <i>Le Jésuit sécularisé</i>.
  A Cologne: chez Jacques Milebram. 1683.</p>

  <p>It is a dialogue between "Dorval, abbé et docteur en th<sup>e</sup>,
  et Maimbourg, Jésuit sécularisé;" and at the end (p. 197.) is a long
  Latin ballad, entitled "Canticum Jesuiticum," filling eight small 8vo.
  pages, the opening stanza of which is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Opulentas civitates</p>
      <p>Ubi sunt commoditates</p>
      <p>Semper quærunt isti patres."</p>
    </div>

  <p>And the conclusion of the whole is, in effect, the line of which your
  correspondent speaks:</p>

  <p>I should be glad to be certified by any of your correspondents of the
  actual existence of the printed volume, which probably was sought for and
  destroyed by the authorities on account of its pestilent contents.</p>

  <p><i>Tradescant Family</i> (Vol. iii., p. 393.).&mdash;In further
  illustration of this subject, and for the information of your
  correspondents who have taken an interest in the restoration of the tomb
  in Lambeth churchyard, I beg through you to say that I have found the
  will of the grandsire, "John Tradescant, of South Lambeth, co. Surrey,
  Gardener:" it is dated January 8, 1637, and proved May 2, 1638, so that
  the period of his death may be fairly placed in that year, as suggested
  by <span class="sc">Mr. Pinkerton's</span> extracts from the
  churchwardens' accounts (Vol. iii., p. 394.); and the defect in the
  parish register for some months following July, 1637, will account for no
  entry being found of his actual burial. The younger Tradescant was his
  only child, and at the date of the will he had two grandchildren, John
  and Frances Tradescant. His son was the residuary legatee, with a
  proviso, that if he should desire to part with or sell his cabinet, he
  should first offer the same to <i>the Prince</i>. His brother-in-law,
  Alexander Norman, and Mr. William Ward, were the executors, and proved
  the will. As <span class="sc">Mr. Pinkerton</span> stated that he was on
  the trace of new and curious matter respecting the Tradescants, he may
  find it useful to know that John Tradescant the elder held the lease of
  some property at Woodham Water in Essex, and two houses in Long Acre and
  Covent Garden.</p>

  <p><i>Arms of Joan d'Arc</i> (Vol. vii., p. 210.).&mdash;I believe I can
  answer the inquiry of <span class="sc">Bend</span>. The family of Joan
  d'Arc was ennobled by Charles VII. in December, 1429, with a grant of the
  following magnificent armorial coat, viz. Azure, between two
  fleurs-de-lys, or, a sword in pale, point upwards (the hilt or the blade
  argent), in chief, on the sword's point, an open crown,
  <i>fleur-de-lysé</i>, or.</p>

  <p>In consequence of the proud distinction thus granted, of bearing for
  their arms the fleur-de-lys of France, the family assumed the name of
  <i>Du Lys</i> d'Arc, which their descendants continued to bear, until (as
  was supposed) the line became extinct in the last century, in the person
  of Coulombe du Lys, Prior of Coutras, who died in 1760; but the fact is,
  that the family still exists in this country in the descendants of a
  Count Du Lys, who settled in Hampshire as a refugee at the revocation of
  the Edict of Nantes (he having embraced the Protestant religion). His
  eldest male descendant, and (as I believe) the representative of the
  ancient and noble family of Du Lys d'Arc, derived from a brother of the
  Maid of Orleans, is a most worthy friend and neighbour of mine, the Rev.
  J. T. Lys, Fellow of Exeter College, whose ancestors, since the period of
  their settlement in England, thought proper to drop the foreign title,
  and to curtail their name to its present form.</p>

  have a peculiar and disagreeable <i>smell</i>, is, perhaps, older than he

  <p>I believe the reference "lib. 4. xx." is inaccurate. At least I have
  not succeeded in finding the lines. That may be an excusable mistake: not
  so the citing "an Italian author," instead of giving his name, or saying
  that the writer had forgotten it.</p>

  <p><i>Philip d'Auvergne</i> (Vol. vii., p. 236.).&mdash;This cadet of a
  Jersey family, whose capture, when a lieutenant in our royal navy, led to
  his being in Paris as a prisoner on parole, and thereby eventually to his
  adoption by the last Prince of Bouillon, was a person of too much
  notoriety to make it necessary to tell the tale of his various fortunes
  in your columns; of his imprisonment in the Bastile, and subsequently for
  a short period in the Temple; his residence at Mont Orgueil Castle in
  Jersey, for the purpose of managing communications with royalists or
  other agents, on the opposite French coast; or the dates of his
  successive commissions in the navy, in which he got upon the list of
  rear-admirals in 1805, and was a vice-admiral of the blue in 1810.</p>

  <p>I have not access at present to any list of the <i>Lives of Public

  of him in that publication; and there can be no doubt but that any
  necrology, of the date of his death, would contain details at some
  length.</p>

  <p>I suspect there is mistake in Brooke's <i>Gazetteer</i>, as quoted by
  E. H. A., for I feel rather confident that the reigning duke had no son
  living when he made over the succession to one whom he did not know to be
  a relation, though bearing the family name.</p>

  <p>As, however, this adopted representative of the Dukes De Bouillon has
  been mentioned, it may be a fit occasion to ask if any of your Jersey
  readers can tell what became, at his death, of a beautifully preserved
  and illuminated French translation of the Scriptures, which he showed to
  your correspondent in 1814, as having been the gift of the Black Prince's
  captive, King John of France, to the Duc De Berri, his son, from whom it
  had passed into the possession of the Ducs De Bouillon. His highness (for
  the concession of this style was still a result of his dukedom) said,
  that he had lent this Bible for a while to the British Antiquarian
  Society, which had engraved some costumes and figures from the vignettes

  <p><i>Jewish Lineaments</i> (Vol. vi., p. 362.).&mdash;Is this Query put
  in reference to the individual or the race? In either case the lineaments

  have an instance in my own family, wherein the person, though only three
  removes from true Jewish blood, retains only the faintest trace of Jewish
  ancestry. In the second instance, the cause of the change is more subtle.
  The Jew, as long as he adheres to Judaism, mingles with Hebrew people,
  adopts their manners, shares their pursuits, and imbibes their tone of
  thought. Just as the character is reflected in the countenance, so will
  he maintain his Jewish looks; but as soon as he adopts Christian views,
  and mingles with Christian people, he will lose those peculiarities of
  countenance, the preservation of which depended on his former career. We
  see examples of this in those Franks who have resided <!-- Page 297
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>{297}</span>for a long
  time in the East, adopting the dress and customs of the people they have
  mingled with. Such persons acquire an Eastern tone of countenance, and
  many have been mistaken by their friends for veritable Turks or Arabs,
  the countenance having acquired the expression of the people with whom
  they have mingled most freely. The same fact is illustrated in the
  countenances of aged couples, especially in country places. Frequently
  these, though widely distinct in appearance when first married, grow at
  last exactly like each other, and in old age are sometimes scarcely to be
  distinguished by the features.</p>

  <p>If not quite to the purpose, these instances illustrate the
  correspondence of the life and the looks, which is the philosophy of the
  Query on Jewish lineaments.</p>

  <p><i>Sotadic Verses</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 209. 352. 445.).&mdash;There is
  an English example of this kind of line, attributed, I think, to Taylor
  the Water Poet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Lewd did I live &amp; evil I did dwel."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To make this perfect, however, "and" must not be written at full
  length, and "dwell" must be content with half its usual amount of
  liquid.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to make <i>sense</i> of any of the Latin Sotadics
  quoted in "N. &amp; Q.," except that beginning "Signa te," &amp;c. Even
  the clue given by the mention of the legend in p. 209. does not enable
  one to find a meaning in "Roma tibi," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers tell me whence comes the following Sotadic
  Elegiac poem, and construe it for me?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Salta, tu levis es; summus se si velut Atlas,</p>
      <p class="i1">(Omina ne sinimus,) suminis es animo.</p>
      <p>Sin, oro, caret arcanâ cratera coronis</p>
      <p class="i1">Unam arcas, animes semina sacra manu.</p>
      <p>Angere regnato, mutatum, o tangere regna,</p>
      <p class="i1">Sana tero, tauris si ruat oret anas:</p>
      <p>Milo subi rivis, summus si viribus olim,</p>
      <p class="i1">Muta sedes; animal lamina sede satum.</p>
      <p>Tangeret, i videas, illisae divite regnat;</p>
      <p class="i1">Aut atros ubinam manibus orta tua!</p>
      <p>O tu casurus, rem non mersurus acuto</p>

  <p><i>Bells at Funerals</i> (Vol. ii., p. 478.).&mdash;The following
  extract will doubtless be interesting to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Gatty</span>, if it has hitherto escaped his notice:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"June 27 (1648).&mdash;The visitors ordered that the bellman of the
  university should not go about in such manner as was heretofore used at
  the funeral of any member of the university. This was purposely to
  prevent the solemnity that was to be performed at the funeral of Dr.
  Radcliffe, Principal of B. N. C., lately dead. For it must be known that
  it hath been the custom, time out of mind, that when head of house,
  doctor, or master of considerable degree was to be buried, the university
  bellman was to put on the gown and the formalities of the person defunct,
  and with his bell go into every college and hall, and there make open
  proclamation, after two rings with his bell, that forasmuch as God had
  been pleased to take out of the world such a person, he was to give
  notice to all persons of the university, that on such a day, and at such
  an hour, he was solemnly to be buried, &amp;c. But the visitors did not
  only forbid this, but <i>the bellman's going before the corpse, from the
  house or college, to the church or chapel</i>."&mdash;A. Wood, quoted in
  <i>Oxoniana</i>, vol. iv. p. 206.</p>

  <p><i>Collar of SS.</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 182. 352.).&mdash;There is, in the
  church of Fanfield, Yorkshire, among other tombs and effigies of the
  Marmions, the original lords of the place, a magnificent tomb of
  alabaster, on which are the recumbent figures of a knight and his lady,
  in excellent preservation. These are probably effigies of Robert Marmion
  and his wife Lota, second daughter of Herbert de St. Quintin, who died in
  the latter part of the fourteenth, or early in the fifteenth century. The
  armour of the knight is of this period, and he is furnished with the SS.
  collar of Lancaster, which is developed in a remarkably fine manner. His
  juppon is furnished with the vaire, the bearing of the Marmion, whilst
  the chevronels of St. Quintin are evident on the mantle of the lady. Over
  the tomb is placed a herse of iron, furnished with stands for holding
  lighted candles or torches.</p>

  <p><i>Dr. Marshall</i> (Vol. vii., p. 83.).&mdash;I beg to inform U. I.
  S. that the King's chaplain and Dean of Gloucester in 1682 was not
  <i>Anthony</i>, but <i>Thomas</i> Marshall, D.D., Rector of Lincoln
  College, Oxford, a great benefactor to his college and the university,
  and highly distinguished for his knowledge of the Oriental and Teutonic
  languages.</p>

  <p><i>Shelton Oak</i> (Vol. vii., p. 193.).&mdash;Shelton Oak is a
  remarkable fine tree, and is still standing. It is apparently in a
  healthy state. The grounds and mansion (I believe) are in the possession
  of two maiden ladies, who allow visitors free access to this interesting
  object. In summer time its owners and their friends frequently tea within
  its venerable trunk.</p>

  <p>The acorns are dealt out to those who may wish them at a trifling sum,
  and the money devoted towards the building of a church in the
  neighbouring locality. It is to be hoped that no innovation or local
  improvement will ever necessitate its removal.</p>

  <p>"<i>God and the world</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 134.).&mdash;Fulke Greville,
  Lord Brooke, was the author of the lines quoted by W. H., but he has not
  given them correctly. They may be found in the <span
  class="sm">LXVI.</span> <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>and <span class="sm">LXVII.</span> stanzas
  of his <i>Treatie of Warres</i>, and are as follows:</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"God and the world they worship still together,</p>

  <p><i>Dreng</i> (Vol. vii., p. 39.).&mdash;<i>Dreng</i> is still the
  Danish term for a servant or a boy: their present station in society
  could perhaps be only found by a correspondence with Copenhagen; and
  would then possibly give as little elucidation of their former social
  position as an explanation of our modern villain would throw any light
  upon the villani of <i>Domesday Book</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Meals</i> (Vol. vii., p. 208.).&mdash;In Celtic, the word
  <i>Meall</i> means any rising ground of a round form, such as a low
  hillock; and the name of <i>Mealls</i> may have been given to sand-banks
  from having a resemblance to small hills at low water.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Fras. Crossley.</span></p>

  <p>Along the sea-margin of the tongue of land between the rivers Mersey
  and Dee, the sand has been thrown up in domes. Two little hamlets built
  among those sand-hills are called North and South Meols.</p>

  <p><i>Richardson or Murphy</i> (Vol. vii., p. 107.).&mdash;I possess a
  copy of <i>Literary Relics of the late Joseph Richardson, Esq., formerly
  of St. John's College, Cambridge, &amp;c.</i>, 4to.: London, 1807.
  Prefixed, is a line engraving by W. J. Newton, from a painting by M. A.
  Shee, Esq., R.A. This is a subscriber's copy, and belonged as such to one
  of my nearest relatives. The inscription at the bottom of the plate is
  the same as that mentioned by your correspondent; and I cannot but think
  the portrait is really that of J. Richardson. The book was published by
  Ridgway, No. 170. Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>SOME ACCOUNT of DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE in ENGLAND, from the Conquest to
  the end of the Thirteenth Century, with numerous Illustrations of
  Existing Remains from Original Drawings. By T. HUDSON TURNER.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What Horace Walpole attempted, and what Sir Charles Lock Eastlake has
  done for oil-painting&mdash;elucidated its history and traced its
  progress in England by means of the records of expenses and mandates of
  the successive Sovereigns of the realm&mdash;Mr. Hudson Turner has now
  achieved for Domestic Architecture in this country during the twelfth and
  thirteenth centuries."&mdash;<i>Architect.</i></p>

  <p>"The book of which the title is given above is one of the very few
  attempts that have been made in this country to treat this interesting
  subject in anything more than a superficial manner.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and research, and he has
  consequently laid before the reader much interesting information. It is a
  book that was wanted, and that affords us some relief from the mass of
  works on Ecclesiastical Architecture with which of late years we have
  been deluged.</p>

  <p>"The work is well illustrated throughout with wood-engravings of the
  more interesting remains, and will prove a valuable addition to the
  antiquary's library."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"It is as a text-book on the social comforts and condition of the
  Squires and Gentry of England during the twelfth and thirteenth
  centuries, that the leading value of Mr. Turner's present publication
  will be found to consist.</p>

  <p>"Turner's handsomely-printed volume is profusely illustrated with
  careful woodcuts of all important existing remains, made from drawings by
  Mr. Blore and Mr. Twopeny."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
